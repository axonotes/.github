## üéØ The Problem We Solve

It's 2 AM. Your group project is due tomorrow. You're frantically switching between your shared document (where someone just accidentally deleted a crucial paragraph), a separate chat app pinging with conflicting ideas, your personal notes scattered across three different apps, and the course portal for assignment details. Your study planner is a forgotten spreadsheet, and the thought of making flashcards for the upcoming exam feels like another mountain to climb. **Sound familiar?**

Axonotes is being built to end this chaos.

## ‚ú® Our Vision: Axonotes

Axonotes aims to be the ultimate command center for students and educators, tackling the common frustrations of digital learning and teaching. We're building the tool we wish we had ‚Äì a single, streamlined platform where notes, collaboration, planning, learning tools, and communication live together seamlessly, built specifically for academic life.

We're focused on:

*   **Unifying Your Workflow:** No more app-switching. Notes, tasks, chat, and learning tools in one place.
*   **Effortless Collaboration:** Work together in real-time without the usual headaches, with features like line-level locking.
*   **Powerful Knowledge Creation:** Flexible note-taking (Markdown, rich text, infinite canvases, pen support), content tools to capture and connect your ideas, \( \LaTeX \) support, and code snippets.
*   **Smart Planning & Organization:** Integrated planning, powerful global search, knowledge graphs, and calendar integration.
*   **Enhanced Learning & Teaching:** Interactive exercises, and a reimagined, integrated flashcard system with spaced repetition.
*   **Work Anywhere, Anytime:** True offline-first functionality across all your devices (Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile).
*   **Never Lose Your Work:** Revolutionary version history (powered by SpaceTimeDB) that saves every change.
*   **Secure & Private by Design:** Built with Swiss precision, with plans for optional End-to-End Encryption (E2EE).

## üöÄ Key Features (Highlights)

*   **All-in-One Academic Suite:** Notes, tasks, communication, and specialized learning tools.
*   **Seamless Collaboration:** Real-time co-authoring, integrated chat, and institutional channels.
*   **Powerful Note-Taking:** Flexible editor, Markdown, pen support, \( \LaTeX \), rich content embedding.
*   **Smart Organization:** Bi-directional linking, graph view, global search, task management, integrated calendar.
*   **Boosted Learning:** Interactive exercises, integrated flashcards with spaced repetition.
*   **AI-Powered Assistance (Future Pro):** Summaries, Q&A, exercise generation.
*   **Offline-First & Cross-Platform:** Work seamlessly online or offline.
*   **Revolutionary Version History:** Every keystroke saved, easily restorable.
*   **Extensible & Efficient:** Custom hotkeys, import/export (PDF, Word, Markdown).
